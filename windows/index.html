            <h2>Our windows</h2>
            Not satisfied with double gazing, ours are triple glazed. And we don’t accept typical ’developer quality’
            unbranded aluminium frames: our windows are warm, eco-friendly wood.
            <br>
            Our bi-folds are triple glazed too. We have to use aluminium for technical reasons, so we sought out the
            world’s best-engineered, highest spec bi-folds.
            <br>
            Finally, we’re mindful you don’t want to worry about regular repainting – so our exterior frames are clad in
            maintenance-free aluminium.
