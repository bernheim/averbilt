                <p>Åverbilt* Homes came about when Ofir Chen and Gabriel Hodes found they shared a common mindset when it came to developing and building homes: they both have a passion for each and all their projects, and an obsession with quality.</p>
                <p>After many years of working independently, they each found it reassuring to have a partner who shared their values – and they resolved to work together to jointly pursue their ideal of building eco-friendly homes they would be proud of – and happy to live in.</p>

                        A fervent Lego constructor in his youth – Gabriel took some time to find his calling in property.  After qualifying as a Chartered Accountant, he spent some years in the film business where he discovered how hard it is to realise your dream projects.  His search for a home for his Swedish wife and their family made him aware of the opportunity to build better homes than those they found available. After building two homes for themselves – and a number of other projects for resale, he met Ofir – and the rest is history.
